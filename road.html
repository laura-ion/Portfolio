  <h2><a href="road.html">"On The Road #4"  x , acrylic on masonite, 2024</a></h2>

<p> This painting is the first of my â€œOn The Road'' series. I wanted it to serve as a type of cover art for the whole series. My idea for the series is to highlight the things you see on the roads of America, and to tell a story of all the places I've been and things I've seen, so I thought it was appropriate for this piece to depict many of the subject matters I will continue to paint about throughout this series. When I think back to the road trips I've taken, the things that stand out to me along the road are always the discarded items, and the dullness of some of the roads. I really wanted to emphasize that within this piece, but in a positive light. The dullness becomes part of the charm. </p>
