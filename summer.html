  <p><a href="summer.html">"On The Road #2"  x , acrylic and cardboard on masonite, 2024</a></p>

<p> This is my second painting within my “On the Road” series. I wanted this to highlight specifically a place that I end up from being on the road, my family’s upstate house. We don't go as often as we did when me and my siblings were younger, so I chose to depict my family as younger versions of our current selves. I wanted this to look like a piece from a child's point of view. THe bright colors, as well as the playful illustrative style really captures this. This is quite different stylistically from my first piece in the series, but I chose to include some things from that piece onto this one. There is a red bike in both. I want to carry certain objects throughout all pieces of this series, as I think it'll keep things cohesive even when color palettes vary. I had the idea to have some of the objects in the grass be detachable, to add somewhat of a ‘Play’ element to this. </p>
