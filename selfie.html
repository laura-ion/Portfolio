  <h2><a href="selfie.html">"Same As It Ever Was V.2" x , acrylic and collage on canvas, 2023</a></h2>

<p> This piece is ultimately about routine, and how it can affect you. The tile imagery in the background represents a stable, everyday routine, while the imagery encircling it represents trying to break free from it. My vision for this piece was to be able to have it at any orientation and have the composition be fluid, hence why no matter which way it's presented, there are things Upside down and right side up. The song is really about being unsure where you're going, and where you'll end up, and the effect that routine has on that battle. I stenciled those lyrics on each side of the canvas, to further add to the composition's pattern, as well as to represent that my days are so often the “same as it ever was”. I used cardboard to build up texture and depth within this piece.There is a sense of togetherness between the colors and shapes, and while my painting is a lot more representational, I wanted it to have that same sense of unity within chaos.
