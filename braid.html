  <h2><a href="braid.html">"Tug Of War"  x , acrylic and collage on masonite, 2024</a></h2>

<p> This painting took form on its own, with a mind of its own, without barely any help from me. (or at least that's what it felt like) I chose to use a map of the new york city subway system as , like any NYC kid, i've spent probably Â¼ of my life on the subway, and it just felt right to use as the backdrop of my journey through youth and my own self. I went into this piece not knowing what the end result would be, but knowing what I wanted this painting to convey. That tug of war struggle between innocence and maturity, your mother and your father, and the impending doom of adulthood and what that even means. I chose an image of my mom, my dad and I as the main focal point of this piece. I chose this specific image because it shows my parents on two opposite ends of a canoe, with me on the edge, and to me that visualizes the emotional and mental difference between the two of them. I chose to include elements of collage within this piece because that was another way to visually symbolize being made up of many different parts, which connects back to the differences between my mother and my father that I wanted to show. </p>
