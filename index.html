  <h1>Laura's Art</h1>
  <h2>A digital gallery of my artworks</h2>

  <p>My work is driven by texture, mainly. I enjoy working on solid materials, like wood or masonite. My main mission with my work is to play. Whether thats through the physical elements and texture of my work, like cardboard, or twine, or moveable figures. I want my work to be fun an exciting, and create a sense of whimsy.
  
</p>
  <p>I often find myself in my own pieces, literally. Its rare for me to paint something without myself being in it. I am inspired by the classic american landscapes that you often see while on a roadtrip, and am influenced by color, and the childish illustrative style you see in childrens books. </p>
