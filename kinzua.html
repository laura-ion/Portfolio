  <h2><a href="kinzua.html">"On The Road #3"  x ,  acrylic and sand on wood, 2024</a></h2>

<p> This is my third painting in my “On the Road” series. This one highlights a national park I went to over the summer with my uncle. My reference photo for it was actually his photography. I loved the industrial wreckage and all the intersecting lines within the original photo. I really enjoy nature and hiking, and I don't get to do it very often, so this was a memory I wanted to honor through a painting. I knew that I wanted the majority of this painting pretty dull, so that the neon people I added later on really stood out. I played around with texture in the clouds, by mixing acrylic paint with sand. I found that I really enjoy the grittiness and it created more visual interest without having to brighten the background and take away from the people. I also experimented with wood shavings mixed with acrylic for the fence in the foreground. I made the ‘No trespassing’ sign out of cardboard, and used a pamphlet I got from the national park itself to create the collage elements on it. </p>
