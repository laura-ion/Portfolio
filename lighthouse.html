  <p><a href="lighthouse.html">"On The Road #4"  x , acrylic on wood, 2024</a></p>

<p> This is my fourth painting in my “On the road” series. I found this long piece of wood (?) and I felt really inspired by it. This piece highlights the beaches and bodies of water that I’ve seen/visited before. I wanted to really embody the vastness of some of the bodies of water which is why I chose to leave most of the composition just water. I had fun with the red underpainting, leaving a lot of it showing. I experimented with a somewhat flatter style that I normally would do, and did not really add any bits of mixed media. I added myself into the piece along with a lighthouse, which I took from a real picture of myself. Me and my uncle biked the length of his local beach and we came across this lighthouse, and it was a really fun memory I wanted to capture with this piece. I included the red bike that has found its way into most of my “On the road” paintings, which signifies my travels around the U.S
